INSTALLATION:

 Copy miniManager into any of your webserver folders.

 Configuration:
  Option 1 (recommended)
   copy config.user.php as config.php,
   copy only the settings you want to change from config.dist.php into config.php
   make changes there.

  Option 2
   copy config.dist.php as config.php,
    make changes there.

  If you are using Trinity, don't forget to set $server_type = 1; in config.

 Import from /SQL/*.sql to Database set in $mmfpm_db from /script/config.php
 "install_forum.sql" is optional, you would only need this if you plan to use miniManagers' built in forum.

 If you have issues with proper item icon display make sure the img/icons directory is set to R/W permission for webserver.
 Alternatively you can download and extract pre-cached icons, extracting them into /img/icons directory.
